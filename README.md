# SortedStackPlugin

A Google Chrome extension that suppliments stackoverflow.com by marking the highest voted answer by the community with a unique icon, as well as moving this answer to the first place position in the list. With SortedStack, gone are the days of a question owners selected answer with 5 upvotes beating the answer 1264 upvotes for the first answer onscreen.

Additonally, if the question owner's selected answer is also the community's highest voted answer, a unique icon is assigned to represent this.
